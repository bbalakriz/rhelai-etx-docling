It gained popularity due to its appearance as the time machine in the 'Back to the Future' film trilogy. The car has a 2.85 L V6 PRV engine with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission, producing 130 hp and 153 lb-ft of torque. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 8.8 seconds and has a top speed of 110 mph.\n\nCommon repairs and their costs include engine rebuilds ($5,000 to $7,000), transmission rebuilds ($2,500 to $4,000), brake system overhauls ($1,000 to $1,500), suspension work ($800 to $1,200), electrical system repairs ($600 to $1,000), stainless steel panel work ($1,200 to $2,000), gull-wing door mechanism repairs ($500 to $800), air conditioner repairs ($300 to $600), and general maintenance ($200 to $500 per service). The flux capacitor, a unique feature enabling time travel in the 'Back to the Future' series, is estimated to cost $10,000,000 to repair.\n\nA regular maintenance schedule includes oil changes every 3,000 miles or 3 months, brake fluid changes every 2 years, transmission fluid changes every 30,000 miles, coolant changes every 2 years, and regular battery checks for corrosion and proper connection. The flux capacitor requires adding new fluid on a regular basis.\n\nThe DeLorean DMC-12 was initially designed with a mid-engine layout but was changed to a rear-engine layout due to design and cost constraints. The DeLorean time machine special edition can time travel by accelerating to 88 miles per hour. Owning a DeLorean DMC-12 can be a fulfilling experience for classic car enthusiasts, provided they are committed to regular maintenance and prepared for potential repair costs.","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"dataset_type\": \"summary_detailed\", \"raw_document\": \"<!-- image -->\\n\\n## DeLorean DMC-12 Overview\\n\\nThe DeLorean DMC-12 is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market from 1981 to 1983.

It gained popularity from its appearance as the time machine in the 'Back to the Future' film trilogy. The car has a 2.85 L V6 PRV engine with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission, producing 130 hp and 153 lb-ft of torque. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 8.8 seconds and has a top speed of 110 mph. Common repairs and their costs include engine rebuilds ($5,000 to $7,000), transmission rebuilds ($2,500 to $4,000), brake system overhauls ($1,000 to $1,500), suspension work ($800 to $1,200), electrical system repairs ($600 to $1,000), stainless steel panel work ($1,200 to $2,000), gull-wing door mechanism repairs ($500 to $800), air conditioner repairs ($300 to $600), and general maintenance ($200 to $500 per service). The flux capacitor, a unique feature enabling time travel in the 'Back to the Future' series, is estimated to cost $10,000,000 to repair. Regular maintenance includes oil changes every 3,000 miles or 3 months, brake fluid change every 2 years, transmission fluid change every 30,000 miles, coolant change every 2 years, and regular battery checks for corrosion and proper connection. The DeLorean DMC-12 was initially intended to have a mid-engine layout, but design and cost constraints led to a rear-engine layout. Proper maintenance and budgeting for potential repair costs are essential for DeLorean DMC-12 owners, as it offers a unique and nostalgic driving experience for classic car enthusiasts.","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"dataset_type\": \"summary_extractive\", \"raw_document\": \"<!-- image -->\\n\\n## DeLorean DMC-12 Overview\\n\\nThe DeLorean DMC-12 is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market from 1981 to 1983.

It gained popularity from its appearance in the 'Back to the Future' film trilogy. The car has a 2.85 L V6 PRV engine with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission, producing 130 hp and 153 lb-ft of torque. It can go from 0-60 mph in approximately 8.8 seconds and has a top speed of 110 mph. Common repairs and costs include engine rebuilds, transmission rebuilds, brake system overhauls, suspension work, electrical system repairs, stainless steel panel work, gull-wing door mechanism repairs, air conditioner repairs, and general maintenance. Maintenance schedules involve regular oil changes, brake fluid changes, transmission fluid changes, coolant changes, battery checks, and flux capacitor fluid maintenance. The DeLorean DMC-12 was initially planned to have a mid-engine layout, but it was altered to a rear-engine layout due to design and cost limitations. The DeLorean time machine edition can time travel by reaching 88 miles per hour, and the flux capacitor, which allows time travel, costs $10,000,000 to repair. Owning a DeLorean DMC-12 can be a fulfilling experience for classic car enthusiasts, but it necessitates commitment to regular maintenance and a budget for potential repair costs.","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"dataset_type\": \"summary_extractive\", \"raw_document\": \"<!-- image -->\\n\\n## DeLorean DMC-12 Overview\\n\\nThe DeLorean DMC-12 is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market from 1981 to 1983.
